This year left me with a feeling of responsiblity and ability.

I hope it will always amaze me with the conference starts, sponsors line up, participants grab breakfast and their seats, and the speaker's slides appear on the screen. The sight of a year worth of work coming together in a powerful conference moves me, no matter how much I know about amount of work required to make it happen. 

This year's conference included powerful moments by the speakers, moments that made me glad to be in the room.  The whole rooms feels it when a speaker says the truth we all live, and humorously, the painful truths are rarely about tech and mostly about people.  People blocking teams, people making the wrong decisions, people letting the emotional desire to be right, win, or have power take more precedence over the the logic needed for a efficient and effective tech decision (or business one).  Seeing code or diagrams to explain the tech part never fails to delight me.  I see a ton of my own code and the system I live in, it's refreshing and enlightening to see others.
