My pet project uses Angular 5 for the client side and making it decent to look at became a struggle so I turned to Bootstrap.  
<!--more-->

I can layout a page decently but filling in the details so they don't look like mud is not my forte.  My pet project needed to look half-way decent so I turned to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

With using Angular 5, I kepting coming up short when looking for posting about adding it to the project until I found this [post](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/building-an-angular-5-project-with-bootstrap-4-and-firebase-4504ff7717c1).  My project stopped building so I search Stackoverflow until I found the [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48017814).  

I think my earlier attempts failed to add the <code>@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"</code> to the css sheet so I could have been successful and didn't know it and adding the wrong version of Bootstrap.
