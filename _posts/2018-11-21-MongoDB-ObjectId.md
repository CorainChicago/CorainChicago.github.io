ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")

ObjectId is a hexidecimal generated by MongoDB for ids.  It's an object with the methods, including getTimestamp() (get's the creation time as a Date object.  Every document in mongo must have a _id, created with the ObjectId or manually, and is automatically indexed.  Either way, ids always need to be unique.*

Fun facts of ObjectIds:
* 12 bytes in size and the type is BSON
* Include the timestamp and automatically indexed - so when you sort it's roughly in chronological order <but always a caveat that the order is not exact>
* If you don't set an id, mongo will generate it as an ObjectId for you - so kind of her. 




*I have run into an instance working with old production code where someone thought it wouldn't hurt anything to make the ids for a small, tiny, itsy-bity object all zeros.  The frontend did not laugh at that joke when features started to break and break for no obvious reason.
