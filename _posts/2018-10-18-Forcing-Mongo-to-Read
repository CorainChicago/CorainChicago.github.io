Situation: Mongo is very active with lots of reads and writes.  You want to be writing to the primary and read from the secondary.

But how?

Solution:

spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: '<uri for mongo databased>/?readPreference=secondary'
     
     
It's the '/?readPreference=secondary' that forces it to read from secondary.
