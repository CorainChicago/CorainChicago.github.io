	  <h1>Numbers and Steps (and a Video Too)</h1>
	  <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>

<p>The issue of needing more diversity in tech comes up time and time again. This is what tends to happen when a problem is identified and not fixed (like missing a semicolon when coding JavaScript). This problem is cascading, the lack of diversity causes the tech world to be less friendly, inviting, comfortable and accessible to anyone not a white man.</p>

<p>How prevalent?  <p>At Apple, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/08/13/apple-diversity-report-shows-little-progress/31651165/"> 54%</a> are white and 69% are males.  A year after releasing their demographics, Google provided an update, <a href="http://time.com/3904408/google-workplace-diversity/">70% of the jobs at Google were held by men and 60% of the workforce was white (with 31% Asian)</a>. It's pretty blatant when looking at the numbers.  </p>

<p>What to do about it?</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmei">Sara Mei</a> wrote a blog post about how tech companies can solve their problem. In the <a href="https://devmynd.com/blog/2015-08-09-dev-team-diversity-realtalk/article">article</a> she lists a number of step:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Build up a network of diverse developers, particularly at the mid- and senior levels</li>
  <li>Partner with a local code school</li>
  <li>Hire two code school grads</li>
  <li>Start looking for mid/senior folks in earnest.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need more help (after you read her article), then watch the Facebook Training on <a href="http://managingbias.fb.com/">Managing Unconscious Bias</a>. It's their staff training on dealing with issues in the workplace which end up causing the drastic homogeneous problem present in tech.</p>
