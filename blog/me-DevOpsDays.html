		<h1>DevOps Days as a Newbie</h1>
  		<h2>Into the Wilds of the Unknown</h2>

	<p>DevOps Days Chicago is a tech conference focused on the development to operations side of the tech world. This is where everyone who deals with deployment, servers, security, testing, and all of the systems needed to get code and the things created by code out the door and into use. It breaks walls between creating the code and getting it out the door, asking both sides to work together. In DevOps, deploying code is a continual process.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-chicago/">DevOps Days Chicago</a> was my first tech conference and an ambitious one at that. I was in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp (so at the very beginning of a code school) and had yet to write enough code to deploy, let alone deploy continuously. Later, I was at a different event and was talking about what I learned at DevOps days in relation to the topic at hand. I was told not to worry about DevOps...but I want to worry about it. I want to get my hands dirty creating and manipulating massive code bases, and I want my code to be deployed.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, life hands you opportunities in a weird order. So I walked into the Chicago DevOps conference without a job in tech, at the beginning of my code school learning experience, <strong>alone</strong>, where I was assured to be the odd person out by being female and having to google devops the day beforehand. I walked into that conference and learned so much from the experience.</p>

	<p>So, what did this newbie learn? Many things: </p> 
	<ul>
		<li>First, there's something called "yak shaving", which is when you have to fix and break and fix and break many seemingly unrelated things just to get one thing done. You can read more about that fun term <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15511/yak-shaving">here</a>.</li>
		<li>I watched an amazingly smooth and informative talk about the Orbitz deployment process. They have an impressive continuous deployment system that looks like an automated factory in the slides.</li>
		<li>Don't praise unhealthy behavior! The fact that a team repeatedly stays until 5am to fix issues should not be praised as hero effort. Yes, fixing issues is good, but disrupting a person's sleep cycle is not. Why are you praising unhealthy behavour? If you value your team, stop asking them to harm their physical health, mental health, and social lives. Make the system better so you don't have to call them in, no one needs to create heroes.</li>
		<li>DevOps teams for different size companies require different skill-sets. Companies should hire for the skills needed, not the resume desired.</li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Stop fearing failure.</li>
		<li>Make a safe place to do post-mortems. Post-mortems are write-ups of major issues after the fact. Sometimes these place blame on specific developers. Instead of shaming, make the post-mortem a safe space to discuss what happened and what can be learned from the incident.</li>
		<li>Feedback is important.  Give useful feedback, and thank people who give it to you. It's not an easy thing to do. </li>
		<li>Take the blame out of feedback; state what happened (without assumptions on why) and how it affected your work.</li>
		<li>Monitoring the product is important. Set up a system for monitoring and use it. Monitoring is how you find the weak spots. Monitor so the issues are caught before your customers find them.</li>
		<li>Automate as much as you can in your production pipeline.</li>
		<li>Write tests to check and monitor the code being deployed. </li>
		<li>There is something called the <a href="http://itrevolution.com/books/phoenix-project-devops-book/">Phoenix Project</a>, read it.</li>
		<li>Companies need to think: do I have enough code to need a DevOps team, or do I need engineers to be good at it?</li>
		<li>The audience really appreciated the opportunity to talk about feedback. The room full of mostly guys needed and appreciated the chance to listen, talk and think about this topic. Soft skills might be the hardest to master.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These are the points which stuck in my head in a more permanent fashion. Other attendees might have walked away with deeper, more detailed knowledge (remember: I was starting from square zero). </p>

	<p><a href="http://confreaks.tv/events/devopsdayschi2015">All the talks were recorded and are available to watch to your hearts content.</a></p>

	<p>One of my goals for the conference was to learn what a new dev needed to know about devops and the operations side of a tech team. Here's what I learned in a nutshell to take forward: Make the devops or operations team your friend. Talk to them outside of big deploys and include them in discussions of the code. Work together to get as much automation in testing and deployment as possible, so no one comes in on the weekend unexpectedly. If code doesn't get out the door (or if it gets out the door broken), it's everyone's problem, not just the operations side, so make them your friends at work.</p>
