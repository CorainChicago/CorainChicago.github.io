	  <h1>Good Question</h1>
	  <h2>Putting in the effort</h2>

	<p>Asking good questions is a skill everyone needs to have.  In the tech world, a good question has been attempted to answer for at least 30 minutes, googled, documentation read, and then fully formed with relevant information when posed.  Good questions are appreciated on Stackoverflow, in DBCs Google+ communities and in person. Even the most basic question can be a good question, if posed correctly. </p>
	<p>While good questions are appreciated, bad questions are not. The statement "There's no such thing as a bad question" assumes the person asking has put effort into their question.  While beginner questions are appreciated, beginner questions asked before any research or effort to answer the questions is attempted, are not appreciated.  I've seen this on Stackoverflow questions closed because they are duplicates of other postings or in questions and rants about how the question is answered in the language's documentation.  </p>
	<p>If the person answering the question can google it, it was a lazy question. </p>
	<p>If you google your question, still don't understand the answer found and fully communicate your question, the information found and the parts still needing an explanation, it's a good question. </p>
	<p>So ask your question, just be respectful of the people answering and make it a good question. At some point in time, a beginner learns enough to start answering back and that's when they really start to value the good question. </p>
