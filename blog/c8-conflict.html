<p>Once upon a time, I had a small conflict with a co-worker regarding swimming lessons.  We both taught at the same school and I had given her the chance to take up this prized position in after-school activities.  Of all the pieces involved, she stopped at the part about procurring the pool.</p>
  <p>She stopped, and for months the school didn't have any swimming lessons, but she wanted to be the swimming instructor.  So I tried to encouraged her, give her space to work it out, and finally I went to the pool the school had used before and asked the owner over coffee, got permission, and told her about it.  It was 6 months into the school year and we lived in a country where people drowning was a weekly event, ie, kids needed to learn to swim as access to water came easily but access to a lifeguard didn't happen.  </p>
<p>She was not happy I procured the pool and didn't want to participate in the lessons. I ended up teaching the classes and the kids got the swimming instruction needed.  </p>
<p>The source of the conflict was my frustration at her lack initiative to get the lessons started by inquiring about the pool. She was probably afraid of the task and any potential rejection which comes from asking for a favor.  In talking with her about getting the pool, I think she wanted help getting the pool, for everything to be lined up, and felt I usurped her and her position as swimming instructor. </p>
<p>It was frustrating to have handed the role to her and then watch the class not occur.  I had wanted to do the classes but thought she needed the opportunity more.  The students wanted/needed the classes so it was a losing situation. While I resolved it by getting the classes going, I think handing the opportunity to her in the first place was a mistake.</p>
<p>I felt bad about the situation between us, though not responsible. It's hard to have a difficult relationship with a co-worker, but it takes two to make a relationship work.  Well, at least 1.3 to make it work.</p>
