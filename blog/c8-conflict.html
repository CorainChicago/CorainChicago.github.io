<p>Once upon a time, I had a small conflict with a co-worker regarding swimming lessons.  We both taught at the same school and I had given her the chance to take up this prized position in after-school activities.  Of all the pieces involved, she stopped at the part about procurring the pool.  She stopped, and for months the school didn't have any swimming lessons, but she wanted to be the swimming instructor.  So I tried to encouraged her, give her space to work it out, and finally I went to the pool the school had used before and asked the owner over coffee, got permission, and told her about it.  It was 6 months into the school year and we lived in a country where people drowning was a weekly event, ie, kids needed to learn to swim as access to water came easily but access to a lifeguard didn't happen.  </p>

	Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
What was the source of the conflict?
What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
What did you learn from this experience?
